No government can stand alone. Even the glorious Fire Department must take inspiration from successful and glorious heroes around the globe. You heard correctly, even the enemy foreign governments can aid the Great American Cause. Those wishing to show patriotism for the greatest Nation may visit these sources of great inspiration. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fascist_movements">Here,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-intellectualism">Here,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_China">and Here.</a>

When the intellectuals storm the capitol, as is inevitable, it will have marked the victory of our cause. For it will expose, for all to see, the treachery and betrayal caused by those
poisoned by the perverting influence of literature. When these so-called "refined peoples" bite the hand that feeds them, and turn their blade upon the very nation that has so selflessly and nobly provided for them all these years, we must be prepared. <br> <br>
For when this day does come, these destructive dullards, these Thoreau-spouting thugs, these anarchistic animals must be contained. Every man, woman, and child must take up arms and remain vigilant for the constant, unrelenting threat of literacy. All the good, blue-blooded Americans must band together and help their valiant firemen thwart the tyranny of intellectuals, smug in their supposed superiority and high on the satisfaction of being greater-than. <br> <br>
Our government is strong and swift in detaining the guilty, but it is also just and kind. For it is the role of the accursed Communists and oppressive Canadians to slay their own citizens with impunity. We Americans are unique and superior in part because of our impeccable values, among these is forgiveness of the innocent. For in the case of those corrupted by the poison of literature, the correct thing to do is not always execution, but correction. The simple fact is that those who today suffer from literacy were miseducated, and learned the incorrect opinions. They must be re-educated, so that they can be saved from death and a wasted life as a litterateur, and be reborn, as a phoenix from the ashes, into a good, productive member of society. It is for this purpose that the valiant government boldly takes initiative and strikes first against corruption and anarchists. These dangerous criminals can be contained and converted, with the help of government-sponsored Re-Education Camps&#8482. These camps are not sites of torture or forced labor, as underminers or propagandists would claim, but but places for reconciliation, and learning the error of one's ways.<br> <br>
Our glorious leadership is supreme in detecting and correcting miscreants, but that doesn't mean that the average citizen can't help. We loyal Americans must remain alert and ready to combat the threat of the intellectual hordes. If we remove our thoughts from the enemy, we won't remember them until they sneak up from behind and slit our throats. Watch for signs of radicalism in your children and colleagues. <br>Symptoms may include: </p> </para> <li> <para> Increased awareness of surroundings and details </para></li> <li>  <para> Curiosity or "Wondering" about mechanisms or the reasons for things </para></li> <li> <para> Quoting of authors and insurgent characters </para></li> <li> <para> Promotion of non-preapproved facts </para></li> <li> <para> General defiance or mistrust of authority figures</para></li> <br> <br>
 <p><para> If you notice any or all of these symptoms, notify your local fire department Immediately. Do not attempt to reason with or confront the perpetrator, as you may contaminate yourself or get in the way of the responding officers. Do your part to catch terrorist intellectuals by reporting suspicious characters. <br> <br> HELP ERADICATE DANGEROUS AGITATORS TODAY!
